# This file clarifies and uncertainties in the way that the scripts within this directory work

CollectData.py
- continuously checks and parses incoming data from any of the Arduino modules
	- incoming sensor data will be in the form of a 10-reading average
- writes the data averages to corresponding files in ./temp and ./light 

light (dir)
- houses light data collected
	- files are called <id>_light, where id is the number assigned to each Arduino module
- data files will have all readings received by the RPi, organized by the date
- data is week long; at the end of each week, the file is deleted and started from scratch 

temp (dir)
- houses temperature data collected
	- files are called <id>_temp, where id is the number assigned to each Arduino module
- data files will have all readings received by the RPi, organized by the date
- data is week long; at the end of each week, the file is deleted and started from scratch

scripts (dir)
- addDate.sh and delDataFile.sh are run automatically through the crontab utility 
- addDate.sh takes care of adding the date to the data files found within ./temp and ./light
	- format for the date is dd-mm-yyyy
- delDataFile.sh deletes the week long data files within ./temp and ./light and starts them fresh
- turnModulesON.py broadcasts a signal to resume operation of the Arduino modules
- turnModulesOFF.py broadcasts a signal to halt operation of the Arduino modules
