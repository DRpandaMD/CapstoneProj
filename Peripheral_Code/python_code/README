# This file clarifies any uncertainties in the way that the scripts within this directory work

CollectData.py
- continuously checks and parses incoming data from any of the Arduino modules
	- incoming sensor data will be in the form of a 10-reading average
- writes the data averages to corresponding file in ./sensor_data 

sensor_data (dir)
- houses the temp and light data collected from the modules
	- files are called "module_<id#>", where id is the number assigned to each Arduino module
- each data file has the temp and light data for that module
- dates are listed within the data file for easier viewing
- data file grows up to a week before its automatically discarded and started again

scripts (dir)
- addDate.sh and delDataFile.sh are run automatically through the crontab utility 
- addDate.sh takes care of adding the date to the data files found within ./sensor_data
	- format for the date is dd-mm-yyyy
- delDataFile.sh deletes the week long data files within ./sensor_data and starts them again
- turnModulesON.py broadcasts a signal to resume operation of the Arduino modules
- turnModulesOFF.py broadcasts a signal to halt operation of the Arduino modules
