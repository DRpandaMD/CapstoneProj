SSH
- make script to scp temp/light data file to Mueth's computer
    - would need to check whether computer is on
- make crontjob to run script hourly or bi-hourly
- set up ssh into RPi from any client

Peripherals
- collect new data point every 5 seconds
- change from open to closed when 3 minutes worth of consecutive readings fall within the new state

XBee
- find out how to synchronize the XBees in a way such that if the RPi is restarted for any reason, it doesn't begin execution of the CollectData.py script halfway through the transmission of an Arduino
	- this would screw up the numbers
- make script to update the light and temp data files with Dates
	- makes it simple if Dr. Meuth wants to look at the files; he can see what days the readings are for
	- start a new file each week
	- cronjob for writing Dates and for deleting week old files
- make new python script to send manual commands to arduino modules
	- called turnModuleON.py and turnModuleOFF.py
